# Almost Inverse
Implementation of the **Almost Inverse** algorithm, a variant of *Bernstein &amp; Yang* optimized for computing the modular inverse in scalar integers.

**Important Notice:**

 This implementation operates on a finite field of integers ùîΩùëì, defined by the prime modulo ùëì. There is no efficiency gain or complexity reduction by using properties of polynomials, as the code was not designed for finite polynomial fields.

 The Almost Inverse algorithm relies on a sufficiently large bit size to function correctly. To ensure proper operation, the following rules must be observed:

- The base `g` must be **less than or equal to the modulus `f`**
- Both the base `g` and the modulus `f` must be **greater than or equal to 32 bits**
